This consists of all my work during my time at the Space and Satellite Systems Club which consists of
-Attitude determination simulator for a cubesat using Simulink and Matlab, 
-A B-Dot control simulation for magnetorquers using Matlab
-A simulation of the cubesat's orbit using VPython in Glowscript IDE.




I will add more soon.
